# Luxoria / BRISQUE Algorithm Implementation (C++)

This repository contains an implementation of the BRISQUE (Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator) algorithm in C++. BRISQUE is used to evaluate the perceptual quality of images without requiring a reference image.

## Features
- Self-contained C++ application.
- Implements the BRISQUE algorithm for image quality assessment.
- Supports multiple architectures: `x64`, `x86`, and `arm64`.
- Uses OpenCV libraries (core and contrib modules) for image processing.

## Requirements
- **OpenCV**: Version 4.10.0  
  - Includes OpenCV core and OpenCV contrib modules.
- **C++ Standard**: C++23
- **CMake**: Version 3.21.3 or later
- Supported Architectures:
  - `x64` (64-bit systems)
  - `x86` (32-bit systems)
  - `arm64` (ARM-based 64-bit systems, e.g., Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi)
